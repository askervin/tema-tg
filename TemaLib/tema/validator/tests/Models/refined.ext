### Generic rules for parallel composition:


# Comment transition start with double dash




# Keywords are executed without synchronisation:
# keywords may or may not start with "~", 
# which is followed either by
# 1) kw or vw, or
# 2) target:kw or target:vw


(2,"kw_DoSomething") -> "kw_DoSomething"
(2,"kw_DoSomethingElse") -> "kw_DoSomethingElse"
(2,"~kw_Perform <Action>") -> "~kw_Perform <Action>"
(2,"kw_Perform <Action>") -> "kw_Perform <Action>"


# Starting and ending action words are synchronized between
# action machine X and its refiment machines X-rm*:


(1,"~end_awAction2") (2,"~end_awAction2") -> "model1:~end_awAction2"
(1,"end_awAction2") (2,"end_awAction2") -> "model1:end_awAction2"
(1,"start_awAction2") (2,"start_awAction2") -> "model1:start_awAction2"
(1,"end_awAction1") (2,"end_awAction1") -> "model1:end_awAction1"
(1,"start_awAction1") (2,"start_awAction1") -> "model1:start_awAction1"




# Task switcher is synchronized to every LTS that can execute SLEEPts
# and WAKEts
#
# WAKEtsCANWAKE can be executed only if the action machine
# is in a state where it can be woken up by the task switcher.
# If it is executed, the task switcher next executes activation action
# word (awActivate) which is refined as kwLauchApp by default. Then the
# task switcher finally wakes up the task switcher by executing WAKEtsWAKE.
#
# Original action machines include only "WAKEts" transition, but the
# transition is splitted in two: WAKEtsCANWAKE and WAKEtsWAKE before
# generating the rules for the parallel composition.


# (TaskSwitcher,"${SLEEPts|WAKEtsCANWAKE|WAKEtsWAKE}<${.*}>") (${$=2.},"${$=1.}") -> "$=1.<$=2.>"
#(TaskSwitcherGEN,"${SLEEPts|WAKEtsCANWAKE|WAKEtsWAKE}<${.*}>") (${$=2.},"${$=1.}") -> "$=1.<$=2.>"




# SLEEPapp and WAKEapp are synchronised directly
